JMX integration
	[ref]https://visualvm.github.io/pluginscenters.html
	. downloaded MBean & GC plugins
	. JMX only allow connect locally.
	. TODO: if remote connection required. authentication needs to be enabled.
			but if server firewall enabled, it seems not possible to let JMX client passby.

Change in conf/web.xml migrate to ROOT web.xml
	. moved DefaultServlet mapping from conf/web.xml to ROOT/web.xml
	. moved mime setting for nsjs to ROOT web.xml

Resources expiration filter setup
	. expiration strategy
		a. htm always expire
		b. jsp & servlet always expire (this can be implemented by jsp and servlet themselfs)
		c. ngjs, ngcss, ngmp3 never expire
	. expiration filter setting
		[ref]http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/filter.html#Expires_Filter
	. 

Force reload js from client
	. append "?<vernum>" to the ngjs url, which browser treat it as new resource but tomcat treat it as same one.

		[note]: this approach does not change resource name from server end, therefore will not introduce 
				impact to server cache system. when deploy new version, only recover the old one with the new verison.
				tomcat will do the resource revalidation and place the new one into memory when invalidation detected.

NG resource client updating strategy
	. html or jsp which are no-cache resource has the ability to update the new version NG resources.
	. web client load the NG resources by the version given by bom object from server
	. bom is a JSON formated object which holding NG resources URL and its version

NGO application deployment strategy.
	. static content deployment
		a. package ngjs by confusion & gzip raw js (ngcss only do gzip, ngmp3 do nothing)
		b. generate package bom with path + file name + md5 checksum
		c. ftp all static content to server application ROOT folder
		d. trigger NGO manager initBom ant task
		e. trigger NGO manager validateBom ant task
	. dynamic content deployment
		a. ftp all content under WEB-INF to application WEB-INF folder
		b. trigger tomcat manager reload ant task
	. whole war deployment
		a. do a + b of static content deployment
		b. build war package
		c. ftp war to tomcat server.
		d. trigger tomcat undeploy ant task 
		e. trigger tomcat deploy task
		f. trigger NGO manager initBom ant task
		g. trigger NGO manager validateBom ant task
		


[T0] context.xml isolation
	https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/context.html#Defining_a_context
    [done] 1. move caching & resource of datasource into context.xml in NGO application META-INFO folder 
    [TODO] 2. disable auto "reloadable", it requires significant runtime overhead and is 
				not recommended for use on production
	

[T1] Ant task for deployment automation.
	https://ant.apache.org/manual-1.9.x/index.html
	[done] 1. task for js confusion.
				implemented by /util/ant/task/ngo/deploy/tools/ConfusionTask.java
	[done] 2. task for gzip (js, css).
				implemented by /util/ant/task/ngo/deploy/tools/GzipTask.java	
	[done]	3. task for generate md5 checksum
				new NG resource needs to be registered in include in ngoMd5 task
	[done]	4. task for generate bom file
				ngoMd5 ant task generates the /bom/ngo.bom		
 [pending]	5. task for SCH ftp uploading
		
 [pending]	6. tasks for tomcat manager (deploy, reload, undeploy)
	
			7. task for NGO manager text (initBom, validateBom)


 	[done]	. ant build.xml & properties refactor
				http://www.cnblogs.com/greywolf/archive/2013/04/22/3035520.html
 	[done]	. removed unnecessary resources from building war by "excludes" of fileset

	[done]	2. add cache key removal interface
				a. added interface in cache service
				b. added in controller 
				c. added in BomService
				d. changed mapping path in web.xml
	[done]	3. add local cache statistic interface

	[done]	1. change Expire filter mapping from /* to suffix matching			
			
			  			 
					
	
[T2] NGO ManagerServlet text interface
	refer to tomcat manager implementation
	1. initBom action parms
		. bomFile - the path + filename of NGO bom located in app folder
		. 
	
		a. load ngo.bom from app root folder 
	
	2. validateBom
	
	3. security constraint
