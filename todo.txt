	. 

Force reload js from client
	. append "?<vernum>" to the ngjs url, which browser treat it as new resource but tomcat treat it as same one.

		[note]: this approach does not change resource name from server end, therefore will not introduce 
				impact to server cache system. when deploy new version, only recover the old one with the new verison.
				tomcat will do the resource revalidation and place the new one into memory when invalidation detected.

ngjs, ngcss, ngmp3 resource updating strategy
	. html or jsp which are no-cache resource has the ability to update the new version NG reources.
	. a bom of current version for NG resources should be hold from server end. e.g. database
			and web client always try to sync the lastest verison of this bom
	. an new version publish action from tomcat server should be made by a process like below
		a. a file uploading page showing up in a dedicated jsp.
		b. give a content type in the page before uploading. e.g. ngjs, ngcss, ngmp3,etc.
		c. jsp put the ng content in the desinated folder based on content type
		d. jsp update the bom in database by increasing version number by 1
		e. jsp generate new a bom.js then gzip into bom.ngjs and placed into resouce folder.

		1. web client always request bom.ngjs from server each time a htm or jsp loaded.
		2. web client load the ng resouce by the version given by bom.ngjs
