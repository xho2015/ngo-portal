Force reload js from client
	. append "?<vernum>" to the ngjs url, which browser treat it as new resource but tomcat treat it as same one.

		[note]: this approach does not change resource name from server end, therefore will not introduce 
				impact to server cache system. when deploy new version, only recover the old one with the new verison.
				tomcat will do the resource revalidation and place the new one into memory when invalidation detected.

ngjs, ngcss, ngmp3 resource updating strategy
	. html or jsp no-cache resource has the responsibility to update the new version NG reources.
